# StreamGuide

<h2>A TV guide that displays all the shows you can currently stream from any streaming app, all displayed in one place. </h2>
<h3>The app pulls data from GuideBox, an API that collects data from various tv networks and streaming services. Calls are made using Retrofit. All the shows are displayed in a grid layout. The available networks are scrollable using a horizontal Recycler View. </h3>

There is a detail activity that shows all shows from a network, and another detail activity that displays each episode of that series.
